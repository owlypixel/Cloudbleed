## What is this?
This project was inspired by Gabriel Soares's gooey ghost and recent security vulnerability called "Cloudbleed".
Interesting thing about this project is the blood drips animation. It's particularly challenging because you not only need to move blood drops downwards, but also change their dimensions and opacity. 

You can play around and experiment with it [here](http://codepen.io/owlypixel/pen/KWMdLJ) on CodePen. 
## What you'll learn from this
### CSS
- Applying CSS animations to smoothly animate cloud movement.
- Combining multiple CSS animations together to achieve the dripping blood effect.
- Creating interesting eye-blinking animation
